## Day 36/200 of #200DaysOfAIAndMachineLearning

Today, I explored Seaborn, one of the most powerful and elegant visualization libraries in Python!

### ðŸ“Š I explored:

Introduction to Seaborn

An overview of its core plotting functions (from the official documentation)

Seaborn makes data visualization not only easier but also more insightful with its high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

From scatter plots to categorical plots, I'm starting to see how important good visualizations are in understanding data better â€” a crucial skill in AI & Machine Learning workflows.

ðŸ§  Little progress each day builds the foundation for something big. On to the next!
