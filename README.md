# 200 Days of AI & Machine Learning

Welcome to the **200-Days-of-AI-MachineLearning** challenge! This repository is a comprehensive, day-by-day journey through the world of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, and Modern Software Engineering practices. Each day covers a new concept, tool, or hands-on project, complete with notes, code, images, and useful links.

## What is this Repository?

This is a personal learning log and resource collection as I progress through 200 days of continuous AI & Machine Learning study. It includes:
- **Daily notes and summaries** in Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Code samples** for ML models, APIs, and data processing.
- **Practical guides** on tools like Docker, FastAPI, and advanced Python libraries.
- **SQL practice**, Linear Algebra, and other foundational topics.
- **Images and diagrams** to aid understanding.

## Sample Covered Topics

- **12-Factor App Principles**  
  Building scalable, maintainable cloud-native applications.

- **Dockerization**  
  Containerizing apps for portability and deployment.

- **FastAPI**  
  High-performance API development in Python.

- **Advanced Python**  
  Requests library, HTTP, security, sessions, proxies, and more.

- **SQL & Databases**  
  Practicing real-world queries with classic schemas.

- **Machine Learning**
