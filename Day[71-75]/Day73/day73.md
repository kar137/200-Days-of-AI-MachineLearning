Today, I extended an existing open-source Retail Sales Prediction project originally created by Ayush Dev as a Flutter app, by building the entire Machine Learning backend and deploying an interactive dashboard using Streamlit, scikit-learn, and pandas! ðŸ“Š

ðŸ”— Live Dashboard: https://salesyatra.streamlit.app/

This project analyzes retail transaction data, engineers time-series features, and uses a Random Forest model to forecast next month's product sales for any shop-product combination.

âœ¨ The dashboard visualizes sales trends, feature importance, and provides actionable insights for retailers.

ðŸ”§ Key Highlights:

âœ… Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering: Including lag features, rolling means, and capturing seasonality

ðŸŒ² Modeling: Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy

ðŸ“‰ Insights: Visualizations for sales trends, feature importance, and prediction results

ðŸ§  User Interaction: Predict sales dynamically based on shop/product selection
