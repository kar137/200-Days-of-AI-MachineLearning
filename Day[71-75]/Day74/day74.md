# Day 74 of #200DaysOfAIAndMachineLearning

Had an amazing hackathon experience working on the CodeRush_CodeSprint project! 🎉 Over the past day, I contributed to some exciting features and improvements:



✨ Developed and integrated a Streamlit dashboard for interactive visualization and AI analytics. 

🛠️ Applied feature engineering to enhance model performance and accuracy. 

🔄 Worked on the Flutter backend to automate writing sales transaction data to Google Sheets. 

🎨 Improved UI by refining font colors for better readability.



Collaborated closely with my teammate Diya Shakya and Sulav Timalsina — it was a great team effort, and we shipped a bunch of commits in a short time!

Hackathons are all about rapid learning, collaboration, and building cool stuff. Grateful for the opportunity to push my AI and machine learning skills further. 🔥
