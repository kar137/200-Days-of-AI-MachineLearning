###  Feature Engineering & AI Model Development for Hackathon

Over the past two days, I have been deeply involved in a hackathon project focused on building AI solutions for retail.

- Applied advanced **feature engineering** techniques to prepare data effectively for modeling.
- Developed a **recommender system** as part of the AI model, enhancing personalized recommendations within the project.
- Worked on **retail sales prediction**, leveraging historical data to build models that forecast future sales trends.
- Explored model evaluation and optimization strategies to improve prediction accuracy and relevance.

This hands-on experience strengthened my understanding of real-world data challenges and AI applications in retail.
