## Day 41 of #200DaysOfAIAndMachineLearning

Today I dove into Dash by Plotly, a powerful framework for building interactive web applications purely in Python‚Äîno need for HTML, CSS, or JavaScript!

üîç I learned about the three core pillars of Dash:

Layout: How the visual structure of the app is built using Python components

Interactivity: Using callbacks to make apps dynamic and responsive to user input

Data integration: Seamlessly connecting live or static data sources to the app

I followed a hands-on tutorial that walked through building a real Dash app‚Äîfrom defining the layout and loading the data, to coding the interactive callbacks that update charts in real time.

It‚Äôs amazing how Dash makes data visualization accessible and production-ready with just Python!

Next, I‚Äôm planning to build a small dashboard using what I learned today. Stay tuned!
