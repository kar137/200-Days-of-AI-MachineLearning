## ðŸ“Š Day 43 of #200DaysOfAIAndMachineLearning ðŸ“Š

Today, I practiced hands-on data visualization exercises from the DataVizualization_Student.ipynb assignment. Using a synthetic employee dataset, I explored a variety of univariate and bivariate visualization techniques with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Key skills I practiced:

Plotting histograms, scatterplots, and line charts to analyze salary, age, and departmental trends
Creating boxplots and bar charts for univariate analysis of age and education levels
Visualizing relationships between experience, salary, and gender with scatterplots
Comparing salary distributions across departments using boxplots
Exploring correlations between numerical features with heatmaps
Using count plots to analyze categorical variables like marital status
These exercises helped me better understand how to choose the right plot for different data types and how to interpret visual patterns in a real-world HR analytics context. Excited to keep building my data storytelling skills!
