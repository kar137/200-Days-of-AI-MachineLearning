# Day 72 of #200DaysofAIandMachineLearning

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I just wrapped up a passion project Iâ€™ve been working on StressSignals, a mental health risk predictor for folks in the tech world. ðŸ’»



Mental health is something that doesnâ€™t get talked about enough, especially in our industry. Using data from a real survey of tech workers, I built a Random Forest model that can predict if someone might need mental health support based on things like age, gender, remote work, company environment etc..



Whatâ€™s cool about this project?

- I got deep into the data to find patterns and stories behind the numbers

- Made the model explainable with SHAP values so itâ€™s not just a black box

- Built a simple Streamlit app where anyone can plug in their info and see their risk

Mental health matters!!

Would love to hear your thoughts or ideas on how to make this even better!
