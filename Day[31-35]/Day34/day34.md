 # Day 34 of #200DaysOfAIAndMachineLearning ðŸš€

Today, I practiced data wrangling using Pandas, working through a hands-on notebook packed with practical exercises!

What I covered:

- Pandas Essentials: Creating Series & DataFrames from lists, dictionaries, and NumPy arrays.

- Data Loading & Inspection: Reading CSVs, exploring data with head(), tail(), and describe().

- Indexing & Sorting: Setting custom indices, sorting by multiple columns, and slicing data.

- Data Types & Conversion: Converting columns to int and datetime for accurate analysis.

- Selection & Filtering: Selecting columns/rows by label and position, boolean indexing, and conditional filtering.

## Some of the screenshots are below of today's practices:
