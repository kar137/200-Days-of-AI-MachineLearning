# Day 56 of #200DaysOfAIAndMachineLearning

Today I tackled hands-on exercises in Logistic_regression and Linear_regression, building and evaluating logistic and linear regression models to predict student pass/fail outcomes. 

I practiced:

- Feature selection using correlation

- Training models with both top features and all features

- Encoding categorical variables

- Evaluating with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

- Comparing results with a baseline classifier

Achieved up to 94% accuracyâ€”excited to see real ML impact on educational data!
