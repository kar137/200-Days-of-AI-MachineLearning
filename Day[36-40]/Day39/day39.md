# Day 39 of #200DaysOfAIandMachineLearning
🎨 Today I explored how Seaborn handles different data structures for visualization.

🔍 Key learnings:

- Seaborn supports pandas, numpy, and even Python lists/dicts.

- It works with both long-form (tidy, variable-based) and wide-form (spreadsheet-style) data.

- Long-form data is more flexible for complex plots, while wide-form is simpler for quick insights.

- Even “messy” data can be visualized — just reshape it with tools like melt().

The better your data structure, the better your plots. Onward! 💪
