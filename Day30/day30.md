## ðŸš€ Day 30 of #200DaysOfAIandMachineLearning

Today, I attended the weekly session of the AI Fellowship Program, where the tutor dived into data wrangling with SQL and Pandas â€” essential skills for any data scientist or AI practitioner.

Here are a few key takeaways:

SQL: Used to query and manipulate structured data in databases. We focused on filtering, joining tables, and aggregating data to prepare datasets for analysis.

Pandas: A powerful Python library for data manipulation. It lets you clean, transform, and analyze data efficiently using DataFrames.

Data Wrangling: The process of cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format. This step is critical for building reliable machine learning models.

Mastering these tools and techniques helps turn messy data into meaningful insights â€” a fundamental step in the AI and ML workflow.

Feeling motivated to keep leveling up every day! ðŸ’ª
