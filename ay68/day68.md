# Day68 of #200DaysOfAIAndMachineLearning

Today, I worked with real-world mental health survey data for my project named stresssignals to explore mental health in tech workplaces through:

## EDA & Cleaning

- Loaded data with pandas, checked structure via .info() and .describe()
- Found wild entries like age = 100B ðŸ¤¯
- Handled nulls in key fields like state, work_interfere, self_employed
- Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g. Timestamp)
- Standardized messy gender entries into: Male, Female, Other ðŸŒˆ

ðŸ“Š Up next: Visualizations & feature engineering!
Canâ€™t wait to see how factors like family history, company size, and leave policy affect mental health treatment.

ðŸ”§ Tools: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy
