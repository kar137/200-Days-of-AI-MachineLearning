# Day 35 of #200DaysOfAIAndMachineLearning ðŸ”Ž

Today, I continued practicing exercises of data wrangling with Pandas, focusing on advanced topics from handling missing data all the way to end-to-end data exploration in the data_wrangling_student (1).ipynb notebook.

Key concepts I practiced:

Handling Missing Data: Counting nulls, imputing missing values using mode, mean, and median.
Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates to ensure data quality.
Data Transformation: Applying custom functions, binning, and categorizing data for better analysis.
Aggregation & Grouping: Using groupby for custom aggregations, calculating statistics, and working with z-scores.
Merging DataFrames: Combining datasets for richer insights.
End-to-End Wrangling: Cleaning, reducing columns, renaming, and preparing data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Categorizing product performance, analyzing rating distributions, and building pivot tables to uncover actionable insights.
One interesting insight: Products with an average rating of 3-4 are most likely to be successful!

Excited to keep building my data science toolkit, one day at a time.
